SMXxEnc is an encumbrance remover modlet. It disables the encumbrance system by increasing the carry capacity of the player to the max of the bag space. If you play with BBM's you will need to increase the value in the xml to correspond with the size of the BBM to reactivate this modlet.

> Dependencies: None.

> Compatibility: Will work with all mods/modlets that doesn't modify the CarryCapacity in entityclasses.xml.
